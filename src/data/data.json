Since my actual degree is in another field, I had to learn pretty much everything by myself. The ressources i used the most include Harvard's CS50-Programming with Python and CS50-Webprogramming with Python and Javascript on edX (exercises and projects for that course can be found on my GitHub acc). I also use f.ex. FreeCodeCamp and a whole lot of other sites, including the official documentations for django, bootstrap, react ...etc... I am always trying to improve and extend my skillset.",
